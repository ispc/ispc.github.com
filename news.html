<h1>ispc 1.4.2 is Released</h1>
<p>A minor update of <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> has been released with stability fix for AVX2
(Haswell), fix for Win32 platform and performance improvements on Xeon Phi.
As usual, it's available on all supported platforms (Windows, Linux and MacOS).
This version supports LLVM 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, but now we are recommending
to avoid 3.1, as it's known to contain a number of stability problems and we are
planning to deprecate its support soon.
The released binaries are built with 3.3.</p>

include <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">delete</tt> for dynamic memory allocation in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
programs, &quot;local&quot; atomic operations in the standard library, and a new
scalar compilation target.  See the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ispc/ispc/tree/master/docs/ReleaseNotes.txt">1.1.4 release notes</a> for details.</p>

<div class="section" id="ispc-1-1-3-is-released">
<h1>ispc 1.1.3 is Released</h1>
<p>With this release, the language now supports &quot;switch&quot; statements, with the same semantics and syntax as in C.</p>
<p>This release includes fixes for two important performance related issues:
the quality of code generated for &quot;foreach&quot; statements has been
substantially improved, and performance regression with code for &quot;gathers&quot;
that was introduced in v1.1.2 has been fixed in this release.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jean-Luc Duprat for a number of patches that improve support for
building on various platforms, and to Pierre-Antoine Lacaze for patches so
that ispc builds under MinGW.</p>
