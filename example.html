        <h1 class="title">A Simple ispc Example</h1>
<p>Here is a walkthrough of a simple example of using <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> to
  compute an image of the Mandelbrot set.  The full source code for this
  example is in the <tt class="docutils literal">examples/mandelbrot</tt> directory of
  the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> distribution; below is a lightly modified version of
  that example.  (For example, we have elided some of the details related
  to benchmarking and writing the final output image that are in the
  actual <tt class="docutils literal">mandelbrot.cpp</tt> file there.)
</p>
<p>First we have some code in the main program
  file, <tt class="docutils literal">mandelbrot.cpp</tt>, which is implemented in C++.  We mostly
  have a regular C++ source file that sets a number of variables that drive
  the overall computation and allocates memory to store the result of the
  Mandelbrot set computation.  The call to <tt class="docutils literal">mandelbrot_ispc</tt> is a
  regular subroutine call, though in this case it's calling out to code
  that was written in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> rather than in C/C++.  Because
  the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> compiler generates regular object files using standard
  C/C++ calling conventions, this kind of close interoperation between the
  two languages is straightforward.
</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
int main() {
    unsigned int width = 768, height = 512;
    float x0 = -2., x1 = 1.;
    float y0 = -1., y1 = 1.;
    int maxIterations = 256;
    int *buf = new int[width*height];

    mandelbrot_ispc(x0, y0, x1, y1, width, height, maxIterations, buf);

    // write output...
}
</pre>

<p>
Here is the start of the definition of the <tt class="docutils literal">mandelbrot_ispc()</tt>
function that the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> compiler compiles.  (This function is
defined in the <tt class="docutils literal">mandelbrot.ispc</tt> file.)  There are a four main
things to notice here.
</p>
<ol>
<li>The <tt class="docutils literal">export</tt> qualifier indicates that this function should be
  made available to be called by C/C++ code, not just from
  other <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> functions.</li>
<li>This function directly takes parameters passed by the C/C++ code as
  regular function parameters.  No API calls or a runtime library are
  necessary to set parameter values to pass to this function.</li>
<li>The parameters are all tagged with the <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt>
  qualifier. This qualifier indicates that a variable has the same
  value for all of the concurrently-executing program instances; it is
  discussed in more detail in the <a href="ispc.html">ispc User's
  Manual</a>.  Any values passed from the application to the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
  program must be <tt class="docutils literal">uniform</tt>.</li>
<li>The pointer to the output buffer is passed as an unsized array.  Just
  like in C, arrays in function calls are converted to pointers to the
  first element of the array.  (This parameter could also be declared to
  just be a pointer.)  Like the other function parameters, this buffer is
  passed from the application to the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> code without any copying
  or reformatting, as would be required with a driver model based
  implementation.</li>
</ol>

<pre class="literal-block">
export void mandelbrot_ispc(uniform float x0, uniform float y0, 
                            uniform float x1, uniform float y1,
                            uniform int width, uniform int height, 
                            uniform int maxIterations,
                            uniform int output[]) {
</pre>

The function implementation starts by computing the step between pixels in
the x and y directions.

<pre class="literal-block">
    float dx = (x1 - x0) / width;
    float dy = (y1 - y0) / height;
</pre>

<p>
Next, the function loops over the pixels of the image with a doubly-nested
loop.  The outer loop is a regular loop over scanlines, while the inner
loop introduces a new looping construct provided
by <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt>.  In general, <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> specifies
parallel iteration over an n-dimensional range of integer values.  In this
case, it specifies parallel iteration over a 1-D range of pixels in a
scanline.  Each time through the loop, the iteration variable <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt>
takes on values corresponding to a small range of the domain.
</p>

<p>For example, if <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> was generating code to run in 8-wide
parallel fashion for an 8-wide AVX SIMD unit, <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> would have the
values (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7) across the group of executing program instances
the first time the loop executed, (8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) the second
time the loop executed, and so forth.  See the other examples in
the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> distribution for other examples of using <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt>
to perform this mapping for other computations.
</p>

<pre class="literal-block">
    for (uniform int j = 0; j < height; j++) {
        foreach (i = 0 ... width) {
</pre>

<p>
Inside these loops, we first find the floating-point <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">y</tt> values that correspond to the pixels at which to compute the
Mandelbrot iteration counts; note that these are also straightforward
calculations.  (Recall how the <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> variable is initialized by
the <tt class="docutils literal">foreach</tt> loop to see how values derived from <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> have
different values across program instances, in this case corresponding to a
number of <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt> positions at which to perform the Mandelbrot set test.
</p>  

<pre class="literal-block">
            float x = x0 + i * dx;
            float y = y0 + j * dy;
</pre>

<p>
Once it has figured out the coordinates at which to compute the number of
iterations, the program finds the appropriate index into the output array
for them and calls a subroutine to do the actual computation.
</p>

<pre class="literal-block">
            int index = j * width + i;
            output[index] = mandel(x, y, maxIterations);
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
Here is the implementation of the <tt class="docutils literal">mandel()</tt> routine.  It takes real
and imaginary coordinates and a maximum iteration count and applies the
iterative computation that defines the Mandelbrot set.  Although this
appears to be a serial function, only computing one result for one pair of
input coordinates, recall that <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>'s execution model is SPMD; the
program compiles down to run in parallel across the elements of the SIMD
unit, for example computing four results from four input coordinates in
parallel on a 4-wide SSE unit.
</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
static inline int mandel(float c_re, float c_im, int count) {
    float z_re = c_re, z_im = c_im;
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
        if (z_re * z_re + z_im * z_im > 4.)
            break;
        float new_re = z_re*z_re - z_im*z_im;
        float new_im = 2.f * z_re * z_im;
        z_re = c_re + new_re;
        z_im = c_im + new_im;
    }
    return i;
}
</pre>


<p>To compile this example, install the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> compiler in a
  directory that is in your <tt class="docutils literal">PATH</tt>, and run <tt class="docutils literal">make</tt> on Mac OS
  X or Linux, or build using the <tt class="docutils literal">mandelbrot.vcxproj</tt> build file
  with MSVC 2010.  Note that the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> compiler generates regular
  object files that you can just link with object files compiled with C/C++
  compilers.  (Here is the <a href="mandelbrot.txt">assembly language
  output</a> from compiling the <tt class="docutils literal">mandelbrot.ispc</tt> source file for
  the AVX target with the <tt class="docutils literal">--emit-asm</tt> command-line option.)</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
% make
ispc -O2 --target=avx mandelbrot.ispc -o objs/mandelbrot_ispc.o -h
        objs/mandelbrot_ispc.h
g++ mandelbrot.cpp -Iobjs/ -O3 -Wall -c -o objs/mandelbrot.o
g++ mandelbrot_serial.cpp -Iobjs/ -O3 -Wall -c -o
objs/mandelbrot_serial.o
g++ -Iobjs/ -O3 -Wall -o mandelbrot objs/mandelbrot.o objs/mandelbrot_ispc.o
        objs/mandelbrot_serial.o -lm
%
</pre>

<p>
After the executable is built, running it benchmarks a serial
implementation of computing the Mandelbrot set and the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
version.  (You may want to compare the files <tt class="docutils literal">mandelbrot.ispc</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">mandelbrot_serial.cpp</tt> to see the few syntactic differences
between a C++ implementation of this computation and the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
implementation.)  On an Second Generation Intel&#174; Core i7 CPU, doing
this computation in parallel across the SIMD lanes of a single core gives a
substantial speedup:
</p>

<pre class="literal-block">
% ./mandelbrot
[mandelbrot ispc]:      [58.570] million cycles
[mandelbrot serial]:    [335.005] millon cycles
                        (5.72x speedup from ISPC)
%
</pre>

<p>
Here is a downscaled version of the image that the program generates:
</p>

<center>
<img src="mandelbrot.png" width="384" height="256" alt="Mandelbrot set image"/>
</center>

<p>Note that all of the exposition up until now has been related to
 harvesting the available parallelism from the SIMD unit in a single CPU
 core.  To fully use the system's computational resources also requires
 parallelism across the CPU cores&mdash;modern CPUs may from two to ten or
 more processing cores, each of which has a SIMD vector unit.
</p>

<p> Thanks to the fact that <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> cleanly inter-operates with
 application C/C++ code through a regular function call, one option would
 be to rewrite the application code to be multi-threaded (for example,
 using the task scheduler provided by
 the <a href="http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/">Intel&#174; Thread
 Building Blocks</a> or
 the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd504870.aspx">Microsoft
 Concurrency Runtime</a>) and to then have parallel tasks that were in turn
 partially or fully implemented in <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>.
</p>

<p>The second option for parallelizing across cores is to use the built-in
  functionality for launching concurrent tasks that <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> offers.
  The <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt> language provides constructs for launching asynchronous
  tasks that can execute concurrently with the rest of the program; see the
  directory <tt class="docutils literal">examples/mandelbrot_tasks</tt> in the <tt class="docutils literal">ispc</tt>
  distribution to see how to parallelize across both cores and the SIMD
  units.
